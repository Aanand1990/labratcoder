Models created. Working fine.

Needs to create dashboard
Next step is to add Bootstrap frontend.
***
Lets host everything on replit.
This seems amazing and it costs less too.
Just 7$ per month.

Great... I understood git.

git init
git status
git add -A
git commit -m 'message'
***
git remote add origin link
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

See I want to be great at something very very specific.
Goal here is to be able to write web application + database model + beautiful front end + kivy mobile app that can use the same database

Thats it. My first goal is to get to that point and use it quickly to create wonderful applications fast.

***

Lets try and focus on one problem only.
How to build awesome front end.

***

At the very end I am coming to same conclusion. Let's work with bootstrap. Complete the task and
get it quickly launched to the web.

Then move forward with learning mobile application development.

***

Goal at this stage is quickly learn to develop front end and URL parsing.
